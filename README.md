A Flutter application built with Clean Architecture principles, leveraging Cubit (from `flutter_bloc`) for state management and `get_it` for dependency injection.

---

## ðŸ§  Architecture

This project follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern, separating concerns into:

- `data`: models, datasources, and repository implementations
- `domain`: entities, repositories (abstract), and use cases
- `presentation`: screens, widgets, cubits (Bloc), and UI logic

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Splash Screen**
  - A simple startup screen shown before user data loads

- **Get All Users**

  - Supports infinite scrolling and shimmer loading effect

- **Get Single User**
  - Shows detailed info about a selected user with:
    - Hero transition animation
    - Centralized user card layout
    - Shimmer loading
